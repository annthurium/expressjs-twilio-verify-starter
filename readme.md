## An example LaunchDarkly ExpressJS app with a signup page

Example [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app that can be integrated with [LaunchDarkly's Node.js server side SDK](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/node-js). This app has a signup page so you can try out various authentication-related user flows.

### How to get started:

clone this repo on to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/annthurium/express-launchdarkly-starter`

Log in to your [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) account (or [sign up for a free one here](https://launchdarkly.com/).) Copy your SDK key. Paste the key into the `.env.example` file. Rename `.env.example` file to .env

With this setup, the LaunchDarkly SDK can access the credentials locally but you wonâ€™t accidentally commit them to source control and compromise your security.

Install dependencies using the following command:

`npm install`

Run the server:

`npm start`

If you load http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in the browser, you should see a "hello world" page.
